   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Vercel**:
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will automatically detect Next.js
   - Deploy with default settings

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   ```bash
   npm run verify
   ```

### Method 2: Manual Deployment

1. **Create Deployment Package**:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

2. **Upload to Server**:
   ```bash
   # Extract on server
   tar -xzf deployment-package.tar.gz
   
   # Install dependencies
   npm ci --only=production
   
   # Start application
   npm start
   ```

## 🛠️ Common 404 Error Fixes

### Issue 1: Static Assets Not Loading
**Symptoms**: CSS/JS files return 404
**Fix**: Updated `next.config.js` with proper static file configuration

### Issue 2: Dynamic Routes Not Working
**Symptoms**: `/calendar/day/2025-10-20` returns 404
**Fix**: Ensure all dynamic route files exist:
- `app/calendar/day/[date]/page.tsx` ✅
- `app/sessions/[id]/page.tsx` ✅
- `app/students/[id]/page.tsx` ✅

### Issue 3: BackButton Component Error
**Symptoms**: `ReferenceError: BackButton is not defined`
**Fix**: Verified all component imports are correct

### Issue 4: Missing 404 Page
**Symptoms**: Invalid URLs show generic 404
**Fix**: Added custom `app/not-found.tsx` page

## 📋 Deployment Verification

### Automatic Verification
```bash
npm run verify
```

### Manual Testing
Test these URLs after deployment:
- `/` - Home page
- `/?view=calendar` - Calendar view
- `/?view=students` - Students view
- `/?view=settings` - Settings view
- `/sessions/new` - New session page
    - ✅ UPDATED: Top bar layout improvements (January 2025)
        - Title changed from "Session — New" to "New Session" and centered
        - "Create Session" button renamed to "Create" and moved to right side
        - Cancel button removed from page for cleaner UX
        - Layout now matches New Student page design pattern
- `/students/new` - New student page
- `/calendar/day/2025-10-20` - Day view
- `/nonexistent` - Should show custom 404 page

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
```bash
# Check for TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit

# Check for linting errors
npm run lint

# Clean and rebuild
npm run clean
npm run build
```

### 404 Errors Persist
1. Check server logs for specific error messages
2. Verify all files were uploaded correctly
3. Ensure Next.js configuration is correct
4. Check if server supports dynamic routes

### Performance Issues
```bash
# Analyze bundle size
npm run build
# Check the build output for large chunks

# Optimize images and assets
# Ensure proper caching headers
```

## 📁 File Structure Verification

Ensure these files exist after deployment:
```

├── layout.tsx ✅
├── page.tsx ✅
├── not-found.tsx ✅
├── globals.css ✅

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Student Addition to Sessions Bug Fix
- **Issue**: When adding students to sessions via "Add Student" button, selected students were not being added to the session attendees list
- **Root Cause**:

  - `handleStudentAdded` function was not properly handling student ID parameter
- **Solution Applied**:
  - Added `existingStudentIds={selectedStudentIds}` prop to AddStudentDialog in both New Session and Edit Session pages
  - Updated `handleStudentAdded` function to accept and handle `studentId` parameter
  - Ensured proper student selection and addition to session attendees

- **Root Cause**: 
  - Nested dialog behavior with Radix UI Dialog primitives
  - When AddStudentDialog closed, it was triggering CompleteSessionDialog to close as well
  - Race conditions in callback timing between student addition and dialog closing
- **Solution Applied**:
  - Modified CompleteSessionDialog onOpenChange handler to prevent closing when AddStudentDialog is open or when adding a student
  - Added `isAddingStudent` state to track student addition process and prevent premature dialog closing
  - Added conditional rendering for AddStudentDialog to ensure proper mount/unmount behavior
  - Increased AddStudentDialog z-index to `z-[60]` to ensure proper layering above CompleteSessionDialog
  - Added `modal={true}` prop to AddStudentDialog for proper modal behavior

- **Testing Confirmation**:
